A new Rust client is currently in the works, and anyone is welcome to begin contributing to its documentation.

The purpose of this documentation is to assist you in constructing within the Core Blockchain ecosystem. It addresses the concept of Core, its cryptography, elucidates the Core tech stack, and catalogs advanced subjects for more intricate applications and scenarios.

Since this is a collaborative open-source endeavor, don't hesitate to propose fresh subjects, include new content, and furnish examples wherever you believe they would be beneficial. All documentation can be edited via GitHub.
